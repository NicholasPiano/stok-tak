stok-tak
========

A iterative stock-taking and client finding application for small businesses

The application allows the client (small business) to respond to specific requests from users (such as batteries) and alert them of their prescence in their local area. While doing this, the application also records the requests and their frequency and adds positive reponses to the client's overall stock inventory, producing a report on a regular basis.
